# Module 04: Data Collection and Processing

## Objective

The objective of this lab is to perform:

- Data collection
- Data processing
- Data visualization

## Scenario

Threat intelligence collection is a continuous process which involves acquisition and triage of usable data to extract the true intelligence. Analysts can collect the threat data either from multiple teams in an organization like network security teams, penetration testing teams, web application security teams, etc. or by conducting the threat intelligence collection manually. An analyst must be aware of working both in collaboration with teams or work individually in gathering the threat information. Data Collection is the crucial step for building effective threat intelligence and before collecting data, analyst must know that the information that he/she should gather can be anything related to the organization or industry for which he/she is building the threat intelligence and this information can include details like threats, threat actors, malware, malware campaigns, etc. or it can also include organizational details, vulnerabilities and security loopholes in organizational infrastructure, etc. The analyst must gather every possible information that can pose a threat to the organization. After gathering the information, an analyst must be able to structure the unstructured data to extract intelligence from the data. An analyst must be able to know various tricks and techniques in processing the huge data that is collected into a structured form and visualize the data accordingly. This structured data will be decimated to perform an analysis where the true intelligence will be extracted using various analysis techniques. In this module, we shall discuss various threat intelligence data collection and processing techniques that can be employed \(and not limited to\) for building effective threat intelligence.

# Exercise 1: Data Collection through Search Engines

## Scenario

Search engines are one of the information sources to locate key information about threats and vulnerability scenarios. Search engines play a major role in extracting critical details about a target from the Internet. It returns a list of Search Engine Results Pages \(&lsquo;SERPs&rsquo;\). Threat analysts and security professionals use search engines to extract information about target threats and threat actors such as industry threats, technology threats, exploit used, exploit delivery method, harm caused, etc. which help them in analyzing the impact of the threat to the organization. These search engines can also be used by the analyst to gather organizational information from an attacker point-of-view which helps in identifying the loopholes or vulnerabilities in the organization infrastructure.   
Dark web is the internet space that is not indexed. It is the place where all active hacker and threat actors operate. The dark web cannot be accessed easily by traditional browsers and search engines. The analyst can acquire large amounts of data related to the threat by performing dark web searching using dedicated deep and dark web search engines and browsers.  
  
**Lab Scenario**

An easy way to find threats and vulnerabilities in websites and applications is to Google them or use other search engines, which is a simple method adopted by attackers. Using search engines, hackers can identify crucial vulnerabilities in application code strings, providing the entry point they need to break through application security. As an analyst, you should use the same methods used by the hackers such as data collection using search engines to collect the data regarding all the existing vulnerabilities in the organizational infrastructure and patch them before an attacker identifies them to exploit vulnerabilities. Also, an analyst has to collect the threat information that is not available on the surface web. To do this, an analyst has to perform various deep and dark web searching techniques to collect information that can be helpful in conducting threat analysis and intelligence building process.
